The various test inputs vary in the number of racks and their distribution. Note that the "typical skew" in this real-life scenario according to the lab scientists is a heavy skew towards lower-numbered samples.

rack_1_input.txt: 
- number of racks: 777
- distribution: heavy skew towards lower-numbered samples (most frequent = 1-2)
- order: racks are initially ordered by number of samples, descending

rack_2_input.txt: 
- number of racks: 77
- distribution: heavy skew towards lower-numbered samples (most frequent = 4-6)
- order: racks are initially ordered by number of samples, ascending

rack_3_input.txt:
- number of racks: 400
- distribution: heavy skew towards lower-numbered samples
- order: none

rack_4_input.txt:
- number of racks: 400
- distribution: mid-range heavy (clustered around 40-70)
- order: none

rack_5_input.txt:
- number of racks: 400
- distribution: relatively uniform (from 1-95)
- order: none

rack_6_input.txt:
- number of racks: 400
- distribution: inverted skew, favoring higher-numbered samples
- order: none

rack_7_input.txt:
- number of racks: 21
- distribution: multi-modal, with peaks art 17, 23, and 93
- order: none

rack_8_input.txt:
- number of racks: 17
- distribution: relatively uniform (from 1-96)
- order: none
- note: this tests the edge case of an source rack having 96 samples, which is allowed but unlikely

rack_9_input.txt:
- number of racks: 8
- distribution: uniform from 1 to 8 (1 rack with each sample number)
- order: none
- note: this tests the edge case that all source racks fit into 1 destination rack

rack_10_input.txt:
- number of racks: 1021
- distribution: moderate skew towards lower-numbered samples (most frequent = 2-5)
- order: semi-ordered by number of samples, ascending

rack_11_input.txt:
- number of racks: 629
- distribution: all 95's
- order: none
- note: this is an edge case
